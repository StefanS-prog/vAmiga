/* This class manages the emulator thread that runs alongside the GUI. The
 * thread exists during the emulator's lifetime but, depending on the internal
 * state may not always run the emulator.
 *
 * 1. Thread states:
 *
 * The following states are distinguished:
 *
 *        Off: The emulator is turned off
 *     Paused: The emulator is turned on, but not running
 *    Running: The emulator is turned on and running
 *  Suspended: The emulator is paused for a short period of time
 *     Halted: The emulator is shutting down
 *
 *   ---------  powerOn   ---------    run     ---------  suspend   ---------
 *  |   Off   |--------->| Paused  |--------->| Running |--------->|Suspended|
 *  |         |<---------|         |<---------|         |<---------|         |
 *   ---------  powerOff  ---------   pause    ---------   resume   ---------
 *       ^                                         |
 *       |                   powerOff()            |
 *        -----------------------------------------
 *
 *   isPoweredOff          isPaused             isRunning        isSuspended
 *  |-------------||---------------------||--------------------||------------|
 *                 |---------------------------------------------------------|
 *                                       isPoweredOn
 *
 * State changes are triggered by the following functions:
 *
 * Command    | Current   | Next      | Actions on the delegate
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * powerOn()  | off       | paused    | _powerOn()
 *            | paused    | paused    | none
 *            | running   | running   | none
 *            | suspended | ---       | Error
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * powerOff() | off       | off       | none
 *            | paused    | off       | _powerOff()
 *            | running   | off       | _powerOff() + _pause()
 *            | suspended | ---       | Error
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * run()      | off       | ---       | Error
 *            | paused    | running   | _run()
 *            | running   | running   | none
 *            | suspended | ---       | Error
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * pause()    | off       | off       | none
 *            | paused    | paused    | none
 *            | running   | paused    | _pause()
 *            | suspended | ---       | Error
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * suspend()  | off       | ---       | Error
 *            | paused    | ---       | Error
 *            | running   | suspended | none
 *            | suspended | suspended | none
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * resume()   | off       | ---       | Error
 *            | paused    | ---       | Error
 *            | running   | ---       | Error
 *            | suspended | running   | none
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * halt()     | --        | halted    | _halt()
 *
 * Inside the main() function, the thread executes an infinite loop that
 * periodically calls function execute(). After each iteration, the thread is
 * put to sleep to synchronize timing.
 *
 * 2. Suspend / Resume:
 *
 * The Thread class provides a suspend-resume mechanism for pausing the thread
 * temporarily. The GUI utilizes this functionality to carry out atomic
 * operations that must not be performed while the emulator runs. To pause the
 * emulator temporarily, critical code sections can be embedded in a
 * suspend/resume block like so:
 *
 *       suspend();
 *       do something with the internal state;
 *       resume();
 *
 * It is safe to nest multiple suspend/resume blocks, but it is essential that
 * each call to suspend() is followed by a call to resume(). As a result, the
 * critical code section must not be exited in the middle, e.g., by throwing an
 * exception. It is therefore recommended to use the exit-safe SUSPENDED macro.
 * It is used in the following way:
 *
 *    {  SUSPENDED
 *
 *       Do something with the internal state;
 *       return or throw an exceptions as you like;
 *    }
 *
 * 3. Synchronization:
 *
 * The Thread class is responsible for timing synchronization. I.e., it has to
 * ensure that the proper number of frames is executed per second. Two
 * synchronization modes are supported:
 *
 * - Periodic:
 *
 *   In periodic mode, the thread puts itself to sleep and utilizes a timer to
 *   schedule a wakeup call. The GUI does not have to take further action. This
 *   method was the default mode used by earlier versions of the emulator.
 *
 * - Pulsed:
 *
 *   In pulsed mode, the thread waits for an external wakeup signal the GUI is
 *   supposed to send after each VSYNC tick. When the signal is received, the
 *   thread calls missingSlices(), which has to be provided by the subclass.
 *   This function tells the thread the number of time slices it needs to
 *   compute.
 *
 * The number of time slices per frame controls the size of a single
 * computation chunk. Per default, the emulator computes an entire frame in a
 * single chunk. That is, it computes a frame, sleeps, computes a frame, sleeps,
 * and so on. A frame can be time-sliced to make the emulator more responsive
 * and let it react faster to external events such as joystick movements. For
 * example, if the number of time slices per frame is set to two, the thread
 * computes the first half of the current frame, sleeps, computes the second
 * half of the current frame, sleeps, and so on. Note that an increased number
 * of time slices increases CPU load and jitter, even in pulsed mode. Jitter
 * may increase because time slices are distributed equally between two wake-up
 * events. Hence, later chunks are computed closer to the next wake-up event
 * and may, therefore, interfere with the VSYNC event of the host computer.
 *
 * 4. Warp mode:
 *
 * Emulation can be sped up by activating warp mode (e.g., during disk
 * accesses). In this mode, timing synchronization is disabled, letting the
 * emulator run as fast as possible. Similar to warp mode, the emulator can
 * enter track mode. This mode is enabled when the user opens the GUI debugger
 * and disabled when the debugger is closed. In track mode, several
 * time-consuming tasks are performed that are usually left out. E.g., the CPU
 * tracks all executed instructions and stores the recorded information in a
 * trace buffer.
