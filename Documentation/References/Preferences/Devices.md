# Devices Panel

Use this panel to configure plugged-in USB devices.

After plugging in an external USB device, vAmiga reads some information from the device. If the device can be used as input device, the information is displayed in this panel. In addition, if the connected device is a game pad, the axis mapping can be ajusted. vAmiga comes with a list of known devices. If such a device is connected, the correct axis mapping is setup automatically. If an unknown device is connected, you have a good change to make the device work by trying out a few axis mappings manually. 

## Supported devices

As of the writing of this documentation the following devices are among the known devices:

- Competition Pro SL-650212
- Competition Pro SL-6602
- Nimbus+
- iNNEXT Retro (SNES)
- Mayflash Magic-NS 1.2
- XBox Carbon Black
- XBox One Wired Controller
- Sony DualShock 3
- Sony DualShock 4
- Sony Dualshock 4 (2nd Gen)
- Sony DualSense
- HORIPAD for Nintendo Switch
- The C64 Joystick

## Supported USB adapters

By using a USB retro adapter, you are able to connect original Commodore joysticks, too. vAmiga has been tested with the following two adapters:

- aJoy Retro Adapter
- RetroFun! Joystick Adapter

My personal recommendation is to invest money into the Competition Pro SL-650212. It has smaller latency than it's predecessor, the SL-6602, and provides the best retro-experience in my oppinion. I can also recommend using an original Competition Pro from back in the day in combination with the RetroFun! adapter.
